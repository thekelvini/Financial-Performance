Shopping malls serve as central hubs for retail and entertainment, attracting diverse customers with varying purchasing behaviors, preferences, and spending habits. In an increasingly data-driven business landscape, malls must leverage analytical tools to optimize customer experience, improve revenue streams, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
Project Name: Customer Analysis for Bliss Shopping Mall
Project Description: Comprehensive customer analysis: revenue, demographics, payment preferences, and mall traffic insights via interactive Excel dashboard for data-driven decision-making. 
By analyzing this data, I will help Bliss Shopping Mall visualize key metrics and enable strategic decisions for its board meeting. 
### Stakeholders: Board of Directors
### Project Timeline: One Week

# 2. BUSINESS PROBLEM

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the financial performance of different departments within the organization. By analyzing the revenue and transaction data, the organization can identify which departments are generating the most revenue, track the number of transactions over the years, and make informed decisions to optimize operations and improve financial outcomes.
This project involves developing an interactive Excel dashboard to provide a comprehensive customer analysis. The dashboard will present visualized insights into:

# 3. OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the revenue and transaction data for various departments within an organization over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. It aims to present a clear and detailed breakdown of the total revenue, total transactions, revenue per department, number of transactions per year, and revenue per year.

Below are the Key Result Areas (KRA) the Board will focus on. This dashboard clearly and effectively answers these areas:
## 1. Total Financial Performance:
- What is the total revenue generated by the organization during the period?
- What is the total number of transactions recorded?
## 2.	Departmental Analysis:
- Which department generated the highest revenue?
- Which department had the lowest revenue?
- How do the revenues of different departments compare to each other?
- Are there any departments that need attention due to low performance?
## 3.	Yearly Trends:
- How has the total revenue evolved over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024?
- How has the number of transactions changed each year?
- Are there noticeable trends or patterns in revenue and transaction data over the years?
## 4.	Performance Drivers:
- What are the main factors contributing to high or low revenue in specific departments?
- Are there any external factors or events that could have influenced the revenue and transaction trends?
## 5.	Operational Insights:
- Which departments have the highest number of transactions?
- How does the transaction volume correlate with revenue across different departments?
- Are there any departments with high transaction volumes but low revenue?
## 6.	Strategic Decisions:
- Based on the data, which departments should receive more investment or resources?
- Are there departments where cost-cutting measures could be implemented without significantly impacting revenue?
- How can the organization optimize its operations to improve financial outcomes?

# DATA COLLECTION
Data was extracted from the Hospital database using SQL. It was then loaded into Excel, and data cleaning and transformation were done to prepare it for exploratory analysis. 
- Dataset Name: Bliss Shopping Mall Dataset
- Source: Hospital internal database system.
- Data Extraction Methods: Data was extracted using SQL. I connected to the Hospital database through Excel “Get Data”.
- Size: The number of rows and columns after appending were: columns =COLUMNS(A1:D1) and rows =ROWS(A2:A98) and file size]
- Format: The file format is CSV.
- Data Dictionary: The columns in the data set include department, amount collected, number of transactions, and year.

# 8.	DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
- Data Preprocessing Steps: Create a table for the dataset
- Remove duplicate: duplicate rows were merged using fine and replace.
- Handling missing values: there are no missing values in the dataset
- I use =PRODUCT(G2*H2) to generate the revenue column
- Data appending: The data was in three CSV files, after cleaning, the data was connected and appended as one single CSV file.
- Data transformation: Data was transformed to a pivot table for analysis
- Tools Used: SQL was used for data extraction, while Excel was used for visualization.
