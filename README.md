By understanding the revenue and transaction trends, the hospital can optimize its operations, enhance service delivery, and strategically allocate resources to improve overall financial outcomes.

Project Description: Comprehensive revenue analysis, via interactive Excel dashboard for data-driven decision-making. 
By analyzing this data, I will help visualize key metrics and enable strategic decisions for its board meeting. 
### Stakeholders: Board of Directors
### Project Timeline: One Week

# 2. BUSINESS PROBLEM

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the financial performance of different departments within the organization. By analyzing the revenue and transaction data, the organization can identify which departments are generating the most revenue, track the number of transactions over the years, and make informed decisions to optimize operations and improve financial outcomes.
This project involves developing an interactive Excel dashboard to provide a comprehensive customer analysis. The dashboard will present visualized insights into:

# 3. OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the revenue and transaction data for various departments within an organization over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. It aims to present a clear and detailed breakdown of the total revenue, total transactions, revenue per department, number of transactions per year, and revenue per year.

Below are the Key Result Areas (KRA) the Board will focus on. This dashboard clearly and effectively answers these areas:
## 1. Total Financial Performance:
- What is the total revenue generated by the organization during the period?
- What is the total number of transactions recorded?
## 2.	Departmental Analysis:
- Which department generated the highest revenue?
- Which department had the lowest revenue?
- How do the revenues of different departments compare to each other?
- Are there any departments that need attention due to low performance?
## 3.	Yearly Trends:
- How has the total revenue evolved over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024?
- How has the number of transactions changed each year?
- Are there noticeable trends or patterns in revenue and transaction data over the years?
## 4.	Performance Drivers:
- What are the main factors contributing to high or low revenue in specific departments?
- Are there any external factors or events that could have influenced the revenue and transaction trends?
## 5.	Operational Insights:
- Which departments have the highest number of transactions?
- How does the transaction volume correlate with revenue across different departments?
- Are there any departments with high transaction volumes but low revenue?
## 6.	Strategic Decisions:
- Based on the data, which departments should receive more investment or resources?
- Are there departments where cost-cutting measures could be implemented without significantly impacting revenue?
- How can the organization optimize its operations to improve financial outcomes?

# DATA COLLECTION
Data was extracted from the Hospital database using SQL. It was then loaded into Excel, and data cleaning and transformation were done to prepare it for exploratory analysis. 
- Dataset Name: Bliss Shopping Mall Dataset
- Source: Hospital internal database system.
- Data Extraction Methods: Data was extracted using SQL. I connected to the Hospital database through Excel “Get Data”.
- Size: The number of rows and columns after appending were: columns =COLUMNS(A1:D1) and rows =ROWS(A2:A98) and file size]
- Format: The file format is CSV.
- Data Dictionary: The columns in the data set include department, amount collected, number of transactions, and year.

# 8.	DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
- Data Preprocessing Steps: Create a table for the dataset
- Remove duplicate: duplicate rows were merged using fine and replace.
- Handling missing values: there are no missing values in the dataset
- I use =PRODUCT(G2*H2) to generate the revenue column
- Data appending: The data was in three CSV files, after cleaning, the data was connected and appended as one single CSV file.
- Data transformation: Data was transformed to a pivot table for analysis
- Tools Used: SQL was used for data extraction, while Excel was used for visualization.

# 9.	DATA ANALYSIS 
## - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before we start digging into all the details, it’s crucial to do exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Bliss Shopping Mall dataset. EDA means we’ll take a good look at the data to understand its main characteristics. We’ll do this by summarizing how the data behaves and by making pictures that show us any important trends. This first look helps us see how the data is organized and what’s in it, So, we can find deeper insight later.

## -Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs were added to tell us the general financial performance of the hospital. The key metric:
- Total Revenue: The hospital made NGN 2,353,478,193.32 in the course of two years and one month (2022)
- Total Transaction: The hospital amd an pproximately 749,080 transactionsn the course of two years and one month (2022)

# Key Insights
- Revenue Growth
There is a significant increase in revenue from 2022 to 2024. Revenue grew by approximately 7871% from 2022 to 2023 and further increased by 46% from 2023 to 2024.
- Departmental Contribution
The laboratory department is the top revenue generator, contributing NGN 449,038,622.60, followed by the pharmacy department, NGN 404,066,850.65, followed by the Surgery and Admission. 
- Transaction Trends
The number of transactions surged dramatically in 2023 (340,673) compared to 2022 (4,295), and then again in 2024 (404,112). This indicates increasing customer engagement or service utilization over time.
- Low Performing Departments:
Departments like HMO (NGN 21,000.00), Obstetrics (NGN 1,927,470.00), and Disease Control (NGN 75,000) show relatively low revenue generation. This could be due to various factors such as fewer services offered, lower service prices, or lower demand.

# Conclusion
The overall financial performance of the organization is strong, with significant revenue growth and increased transactions over the years. The Pharmacy, Surgery, and Admission departments are key revenue drivers. However, some departments need closer examination to understand their lower performance.

# Recommendations
- Invest in High-Performing Departments: Allocate more resources to the Laboratory, Pharmacy, Surgery, and Admission departments to further enhance their performance. Consider expanding their services or improving their facilities to attract more customers.
- Evaluate Low-Performing Departments: Investigate the reasons behind the low performance of departments like HMO, Obstetrics, and Infectious Disease. Consider whether these departments need additional support, marketing efforts, or changes in their service offerings.
- Optimize Operations: Review the operational processes across all departments to identify areas for improvement. Streamlining operations can help increase efficiency and reduce costs.
- Monitor Trends and Adjust Strategies: Continuously monitor the revenue and transaction trends to identify any emerging patterns or issues. Be ready to adjust strategies based on these insights to ensure sustained growth and performance.
